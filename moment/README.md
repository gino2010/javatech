### APP & Server

项目包含两个工程，一个为Sever spring搭建，一个为android app工程

Two projects in this directory, one is spring server, other is android app.

Server写还算顺利，虽然平时不写前端页面，但是还好没有什么样式

It's easy to write server. I don't write web-page usually, but I feel good without css.

App写的有点吃力，好久不写android app相关写法都生疏了

It's hard to write App. I haven't written android app for long time, I forgot related tech.
