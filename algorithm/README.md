# algorithm

算法，作为专业的程序员你会多少？

Algorithm, how much would you master as a professional programmer?

此工程每个文件将实现一个简单的、基础的算法，目的就是巩固学习一下，打实基础。

Each file of this project will implement a simple, basic algorithm, the purpose is to consolidate and learn.

算法也是一种思维方式，这种思维方式甚至可以延伸到很多非计算机领域中使用

Algorithms are also a way of thinking, and this way of thinking can even be extended to many non-computer fields.

### note
由于最近项目的原因，没有时间做比较大的完整系统的实验，所以用算法这个工程练练手。

Due to the recent project reasons, there is no time to do a relatively large complete application experiment, so use this algorithm project to practice the hand.

其实算法问题我还是喜欢python书写，所以时间允许的话我会在python实现一份，或者某些算法只在python里实现。

In fact, I still like Python writing for algorithm problems, so I will implement one in Python if I have enough time, or some algorithms will only be implemented in Python.
